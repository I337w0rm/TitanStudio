## DISCLAIMER & WARNING
This tool performs deep, aggressive modifications to the Windows OS, Registry, and Kernel settings (ntdll). 
* **False Positives:** Because this tool disables Windows Defender, modifies the HOSTS file, and changes system IDs, your antivirus **WILL** flag it as malware/hacktool. This is completely normal for optimization tools of this level.
* **Liability:** Use at your own risk. The developer (I337w0rm) is not responsible for any OS corruption, data loss, or game bans resulting from the use of this software.
